# TOP Project : etch-a-sketch
Second project from The Odin Project curriculum

## Changing Grid Colors when Mouse Hovers over
Benefits I gained from building this project:
* Learn how to target event objects and using events as function parameter
* Use a for loop in JavaScript to create repetitive elements in the HTML page
* Use the addition and removal of class to better visualize which button has been clicked and is active
* Learn how to target different input types in CSS
* Learn how to control the number of columns in a grid container using grid-template
